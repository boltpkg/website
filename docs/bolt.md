Bolt implements the idea of workspaces on top of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
In fact, the Bolt CLI is largely a drop-in replacement of the Yarn CLI. You can
use it on any project already using Yarn.

But Bolt (will soon) do lots of other stuff. Instead of wasting tons of time
setting up a whole bunch of build tools for running your tests, or compiling
your code, what if your package manager just did all that for you? Then when
you want to do something differently, all you need to do is override a script.

Well that's what Bolt will do for you (once we get around to implementing it).

Long term, many of the features in Bolt will hopefully prove to be useful and
other package managers like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) will adopt them.
